title: Working with API
---

:::caution
This functionality requires an experimental `server` plugin. [Read More](../references/plugins-reference.md)
:::

It's possible to start Frictionless API as a standalone server. This capability is highly experimental at the moment and **it's not tested to be secure**. Please don't use the server in production environment.

```bash
!pip install frictionless[server]
```


## Running API Server

```bash
$ frictionless api
```
